  abstract = {This study investigates the application of Singular Value
    Decomposition (SVD) as an effective mathematical framework for
    various image processing tasks. SVD offers a unique decomposition
    approach, making it suitable for applications like image
    compression, denoising, and watermarking by enabling optimal rank
    approximations and noise separation. The robustness of SVD in
    handling large matrices allows it to capture key image
    characteristics, preserving essential features while reducing data
    requirements. By leveraging SVD’s ability to separate data into
    dominant and subdominant subspaces, this research demonstrates
    enhanced image compression, effective noise reduction, and secure
    watermark embedding. Experimental results validate SVD’s utility in
    optimizing image storage, clarity, and fidelity, with potential
    implications for advancing adaptive image processing techniques.}
