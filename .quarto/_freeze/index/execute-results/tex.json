SVD offers a unique decomposition approach, making it suitable for applications like image compression, denoising, and watermarking by enabling optimal rank approximations and noise separation. The robustness of SVD in handling large matrices allows it to capture key image characteristics, preserving essential features while reducing data requirements. By leveraging SVDâ€™s ability to separate data into dominant and subdominant subspaces, this research demonstrates enhanced image compression, effective noise reduction, and secure watermark embedding.

SVD decomposes a matrix in to three constitutive matrices U, S, and V, thus making it possible to represent an image using a fewer number of values @moonen1992singular. This characteristic has practical usage such as for image compression by keeping few singular values in $S$ matrix and stores the characteristics feature of the image, hence reduce storage.\n\nResearches suggested that It can be done if appropriate number of singular values maintained and image can be compressed at higher ratio with good quality The number of singular values kept (and thus the size of the image to be compressed) is always not more (and often far less) than the number of pixels in the original image. Thus, SVD turns out to be a relatively strong technique for applications where a minimum number of storage space and bandwidth is required to be preserved during transmission of signals such as in satellite imagery, medical imaging and photo enhancement.\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a powerful mathematical technique with a diverse range of applications in image processing. While its capabilities are well-established, there remains untapped potential in fully harnessing its versatility. This paper delves into the rich properties of SVD and demonstrates how they can be leveraged across various image processing tasks, such as compression, watermarking, and quality assessment.\n\nThe study presents several key findings. First, the experiments validate known but underutilized characteristics of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in the context of image processing. This serves to aid ongoing efforts aimed at enhancing the application of these SVD characteristics. Second, the research identifies new trends and challenges faced in the application of SVD for image processing. Some of these trends are corroborated by experimental data, while others require additional verification. Finally, this work lays the groundwork for future investigations, highlighting promising avenues for further exploration and development.\n\nOverall, this paper offers a comprehensive examination of the rich properties of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and its multifaceted applications in the field of image processing. By shedding light on both the established and emerging aspects of SVD, the study paves the way for more efficient and innovative applications of this powerful mathematical technique.\n\n",
